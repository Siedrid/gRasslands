# gRasslands

This project is part of the SUSALPS research project, which is researching the sustainable use of alpine and pre-alpine grasslands in Southern Germany. A key indicator of ecosystem health is the floral biodiversity, which can be measured through indices like the species number or the shannon and simpson index (webpage with explanation?). The goal of this project was to estimate floral biodiverstiy at the help of Sentinel-2 reflectances between 2022 and 2023.
This package provides the functions and code used to train a random forest model with the extracted reflectances at the sample plot locations. Species inventories sampled in the same plots served as response variable.
Parts of the data are also available through this package.

## Installation

You can install the development version of gRasslands like so:

``` r
# FILL THIS IN! HOW CAN PEOPLE INSTALL YOUR DEV PACKAGE?
```

## I. Data Preprocessing

In this section you find documentation how your data needs to be preprocessed to train your random forest model. This is shown at the hand of Sentinel-2 
reflectances extracted at 60 plot locations in Lower Franconia, Bavaria.

```{r refl.df, echo = FALSE}
library(gRasslands)

summary(refl.df)

```

The `refl.df` dataframe has a column for each Sentinel-2 band, and two additional columns for the plot names and date of the Sentinel-2 acquisition. In the following this data is brought into the right form to be processed in the random forest model. The data needs to be in a wide table format.

```{r refl.df 2, echo = FALSE}
int.ts <- interpolate.ts(refl.df, plot.column = "plot_names") # interpolate missing values
int.ts <- na.omit(int.ts)
monthly_max.df <- comp_monthly(int.ts, date.column = "dat", stat = "max") # composite to monthly maximum reflectances
monthly_max.df.piv <- pivot.df(monthly_max.df) # pivot the data into wide table

```

In the next step we take a look at the response variable: the alpha-diversity indices. Species inventories were collected in the same 60 plots. Both datasets are processed together in step II.

```{r div.df}
summary(div.df)
```

The alpha diversity indices used are the species number, shannon and simpson index. Many studies have shown, that species number is the best response variable, therefore this alpha-diversity indice will be used in the following random forest model. The code to calculate these indices is provided in the `data-raw` folder.

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.


## II. Train and Test Random Forest

For the training only the maximum reflectances from the months March to September are used. The winter months are influenced by clouds and are limited by less acquisitions, which could potentially influence our results negatively.

```{r Random Forest, echo = FALSE}

m.nowinter <- c("03$", "04$", "05$", "06$","07$", "08$", "09$")
data_frame.nowinter <- RF_predictors(monthly_max.df.piv, m.nowinter) # use only months from March to September
rf_data <- preprocess_rf_data(data_frame.nowinter, div.df, "specn") # merge reflectance and alpha diversity dataframe

train_index <- get_train_index(rf_data, s = 10) # split samples into training and testing (70:30)
forest <- RF(rf_data, train_index = train_index, s = 10) # train Random Forest
print(forest)
```

Training and testing results are visualized in a scatter plot with the predicted species number on the x-axis and the actual species number on the y-axis. Further statistics can be written to a csv file with the function `write.RF`.

```{r Random Forest 2, echo = FALSE}
summarize.RF(forest, rf_data, div.df, train_index, "specn", plot_labels = F) # returns scatter plot
#write.RF("no winter", "specn", forest, 10, csv.path)
```

## III. Spatial Prediction of Alpha-Diversity

```{r}

# write functions for spatial prediction and plotting first
```
